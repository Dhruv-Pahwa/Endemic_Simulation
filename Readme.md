# ðŸ¦  Epidemic Spread Simulation (SIR Model)

This project is a **Flask-based web application** that simulates the spread of an epidemic using the **SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model**.  
It provides an interactive UI where users can enter parameters (population size, infection rate, recovery rate, days to simulate, etc.) and visualize the epidemic curve.  

The graph is rendered with **Plotly** (beautiful, interactive, tooltips-enabled), and the UI is styled for a modern, visually appealing experience.
